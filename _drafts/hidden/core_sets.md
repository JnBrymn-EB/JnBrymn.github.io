"all asians look alike" effect; histograms; core sets

The reason that all Asians look alike is because we are building a
running histogram of features and if we don't see asian features that
often, they get lumped into a big set of "outlier". If we are around
asians a lot then we improve our model by creating new bins in the
"asian" portion of feature space. (It's not racism - it's normal
cognitive shortcutting so that we can function!)

Use this article as a motivating example for core sets and then explain
what core sets are .
