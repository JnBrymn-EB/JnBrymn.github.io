Maximum Entropy Software Approach (MESA) - Develop code by taking the
path that requires the fewest assumptions (guesses) about the future.

1. You don't build features that people will not want.
2. You don't take approaches that will require the most "undoing" to
get on a different path later.


The idea is related to maximum entropy probability distributions which
don't make any assumptions about a distribution outside of the
information given. Given a mean and a variance, the normal distribution
is maximum entropy because it doesn't assume anything about skew,
kertosis, etc.
