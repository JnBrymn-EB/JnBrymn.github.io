Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here \\( x_4 \\) is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory -  edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$



Maxwell's equations:

\begin{equation}
\lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x-1}{2x}}
 =
 \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x}{2}}={\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
